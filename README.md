# README

1. Install database
rails db:create 

2. Install gem file
bundle install

3. To run server rails s

If there are issues with components loading 
- stop the server
- run yarn build
- run rails assets:precompile
- run "server s" to restart the server

I am using esbuilder instead of webpacker. For front end i am using react and some ruby on rails with bootstrap framework. 

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
